 social engneering principles
 	auth
		the  social engneer is in change
		i'm calling from the help desk/office of the CEO/police
	intimidation
		there will be bad things if you don't help
		if you don't help me, the payroll check won't be processed
	consensus / social proof
		convince based on whatl normally expected
		your co-worker jill did this for me last week
	 scarcity
 		the situation will not be this way for long
		must make the change before times expires
	urgency
		works alongside scarcity
		act quickly, don't tink
	familiarity / liking
		someone you know, we have common friends
	trust 
		someone who is safe
		I'm from iT. and I'm here to help

phishing
 	social engneering with a touch of spoofing
 		often delivered by spam, IM, etc
		very remarkable when well done
	don't be fooled
		 check the URL
	usually there's something not quite right
		spelling,font, graphics
	vishing is done over the phone
		fake security check or bank update

spear phishing
	phishing with inside info
		make the attack more believable
		spear phising the CEO is "whaling"
		
impersion

	throw tons  of technical
		catastrophic feedback due to the depolariztion of the differential magnetometer
shoulder surfing\
	looking over someone for info 
		airport hallway-facing monitor etc
	surf from afar
		binoculars / telescopes
		webcam monitoromhg
	tailgating 
	use someone else to gain access to a builing
		not an accident
