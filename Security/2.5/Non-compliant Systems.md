Non-compliant Systems
	a constant challenge 
		there are always changes and update
	Standard Operating Environment (SOE)
		a set of test and approved hardware / software system
		often a standard os image
	os and app update
		must have patches to be in compliance
		os update, anti-virus signatures
		can be checked and verified before access is given
	
protecting against non-complicant system 
	os control 
	apply policies that will prevent non-compliant software
monitor the network for app traffic
	next-gen firewalls with app visibility
preform periodic scans
	login system can scan for non-compliance
	requires correction before the system is given access
