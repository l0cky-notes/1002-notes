what is  Electrostatic Dischar
	static electricity
		electricity that does not move
	static electricity isn't harmful to computer
		it is the discharge that gets them 
	esd can be very danaging to computer components
		silicon is very sensitive to high voltages
	feel static dischage: ~3,500 volts damage an electronic components: 100 volts or less



controlling ESD
	humidity over 60% helps control ESD
		won't prevent all possible ESD
		keep an air conditioned room at 60% humidity isn't very practical
	use your hand to self-ground
		touch the chassis before touching a component
		UNPLUG THE PSU
		DO NOT CONNECT YOURSELF TO AN ELECTRICAL GROUND!
	try not the touch components directly
		card edges only
prevent static discharge 
	anti-static strap 
		connect your wirst to the metal part of the computer
	anti-static pad
		a workspace for the computer
 	anti-static mat 
		a mat to stand on 
	anti-static bag
		safely move or ship components
