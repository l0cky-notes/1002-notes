disposal procedures
	read your material safety data sheets (MSDS)
	US department of labor, occupational safety and health admin (OSHA)
		http://www.osha.gov, index page
	provides info for all hazardous chemicals
		batteries, display devices / crt's, chemical solvents and can, toner  and ink catridges
	sometimes abbreviated as safety data sheet (SDS)
		different name of each country


msds info
	product and company info
	composition / ingredients
	hazard info
	first aid measures
	fire-fighting measures
	accidental release / leaking
	handling and storge
	much more



room control
	temp
		devices need constant cooling
		so do humans
	humidity level 
		high humidity promotes condensation
		low humidity promotes static discharges
		50% is a good number
	proper ventilation
		computer generate heat
		do not put everything in a closet




UPS
	uninterruptible power supply
		short-term backup power
		blackout, brown out, surges
	ups type
		offline/standby UPS
		line-interactive ups
		on/double-conversion ups
		features
		auto shutdown, battert cpacity, outlets, phone line suppression






surge suppressor
	not all power is "clean"
		self-inflicted power spikes and noise
		storms, power grid changes
	spikes are diverted to ground
	noise filters remove line noise
		decibel(db) level at a specified freq
			higher db is better


surge suppressor specs
	joule rating
		surge absorption
			200=good, 400=better
			look for over 600 joules of protection
	surge amp rating
		higher is better
	ul 1449 voltage let-through rating
		ratings at 500,400, and 300 volts
	l	ower is better


protection from airborne paticles
	enclosurs
		protect computer on a manufacturing floor
		protect from dust, oil, smoke
	air filters and masks
		protect against airborne particles
		dust in computer cases
		laser printer toner



dust and debris
	cleaning 
		neutral detergents
		no ammonia-based cleaning liquids
		avoid isoprobyl alcohol
	vacuum 
		use a "computer" vacuum
		maintain ventilation
	compressed air pump
		try not to use compressed air in a can


local goverment requlation
	environmental regulations
		may have very specific controls
	the obvious
		hazardous waste
		batteries 
		computer parts
